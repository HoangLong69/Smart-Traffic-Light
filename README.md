# About the Project
The Smart Traffic Light System project provides an efficient solution for urban traffic management by leveraging the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, USR-E1 Ethernet module, and Yolov5 object detection model. The system is designed to detect and count vehicles (cars and motorbikes) on two roads using two cameras, then automatically adjust the duration of green and red lights based on the traffic density on each road.

# Key Features:
* Real-time vehicle detection: Utilizes the Yolov5 model to identify and count cars and motorbikes.
* Intelligent traffic light timing adjustment: Dynamically changes the duration of green and red lights according to traffic density, reducing congestion.
* Ethernet connectivity: The USR-E1 module ensures stable and efficient data transmission.
* Optimized design: The Raspberry Pi Pico ensures low cost and high performance.
